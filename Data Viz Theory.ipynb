    "## The components of Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "A **definition** of data visualization (Andy Kirk, 2016):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{The representation and presentation of data to facilitate understanding}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This brief definition tries to describe what visualization is about:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data**: it is names, amounts, groups statistical values, dates, comments, locations. In general it can be subdivided in textual and numeric format, typically in a tabular form, said raw. While in this format is easy to look up for values, it is very difficult to establish the comparative size and relationship between multiple data points. To get an understanding from data a visual form is needed\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Representation**: it concerns the choices made about the form in which data will be visually portrayed, it regards the combinations of marks (points, lines and areas) and attributes (size, colour and position).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Presentation**: it concerns all the other visible design decisions that form the overall visualization (e.g., interactivity and annotations).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understanding**: facilitating the understanding is the main goal of data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **process of Understanding** has to be explained, and it involves three steps, where each one is dependaent on the previous one:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Perceiving**: It concerns the act of being able to read a chart. The viewer attempts to decode the representation of the data (shapes, sizes, colours) as displayed and convert them into perceived values (estimates of quantities and their relationships to other values).\n",
    "\n",
    "  Usual questions are:\n",
    "  - where are the largest, middle-sized and smallest values?\n",
    "  - What proportion of the total does that value hold?\n",
    "  - How do these values compare in ranking terms?\n",
    "  - To which otehr values does this have a connected relationship?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interpreting**: After Having read the chart, now the viewer tries to convert these perceived values into some form of meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Usual questions are:\n",
    "  - Is it good to be big or better to be small?\n",
    "  - What does it mean to go up or down?\n",
    "  - Is that relationship meaningful or insignificant?\n",
    "  - Is the decline of that category especially surprising?\n",
    "  \n",
    "  This step depends on viewer's pre-existing knowledge about the subject and his capacity to utilise that knowledge to frame the implications of what has been read. If the viewer do not possess that knowledge, it may be up to the creator to address that lackness. to achieve this, the visualizer can use captions, headlines, colours and other annotated devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Comprehending**: it involves reasoning the consequence of the two previous steps (Perceiving and Interpreting) to arrive at a personal reflection of what this visualisation means to the viewer and how this make a difference with respect to what he already knew about the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Usual questions are:\n",
    "  - Why is this relevant? What wants or needs does it serves?\n",
    "  - Has it confirmed what I knew or suspected beforhand, or enlightened me with some new knowledge?\n",
    "  - Has this experience impacted me in an emotional way or left me feeling indifferent as a consequence?\n",
    "  - Does the new understanding I have acquired do push me to take action (make a decision or change my behaviour) or it just enhance my knowledge about the subject?"

    "## Good design is\n",
    "\n",
    "- **innovative**: it does not need to be always innovative. Often creators are using well tried and tested approaches. Nonetheless, sometimes innovation is required to overcome a particular challenge; usually it when know solutions are not sufficient or satisfying.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **long lasting**: This concept can be interpreted as the preservation the functionality of a digital project (i.e. online links that expire and make the visualisation no more accessible). Also, it can refers to the durability of a given technique (e.g. Bar charts are considered to be always useful. Moreover, it long lasting can be seen as the preference of timeless design approaches instead of the currently trending ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **environmentally friendly**: It has always to be contextualised to the specific project. But as a general idea, the need of ink and paper will necessarly clash against the environmental friendly concept. But also a powerful interactive that is going to be used by hundreds and hundreds of users and that requires a lot of energy supply will clash with this principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Principles of Good Data Visualisation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trustworthy** : this is about the fundamental integrity, accuracy and legitimacy of any produced data visualisation. This should always be of primary concern. Truth is an obligation (i.e. you should never create something misleading, nor claim to present something that presents the truth if it cannot be supported by your data visualisation). Nonetheless, different and legitimate versions of truth there exist. So you have the freedom to chose the one you think is the most right. Of course this bring a lack of objectivity in the process, but you always should aim to demonstrate that the nuance of truth you are showing is trustable.\n",
    "\n",
    " It is important to state that being truthful is not a synonim of being perceived as truthful, regardless of the visuliser intent.\n",
    " \n",
    " **pursuing trustworthiness**:\n",
    " \n",
    " Trustworthiness is persued during the entire workflow process of data visualisation:\n",
    " \n",
    " - *While formulating your brief*: if you are working with an emotive subject the importance of trust is crucial. In fact, in these cases your topic will be more exposed to prejudicial opinions and trust will be precarious. Part of the brief formulation concerns defining the audience, considereing the subject and establising early thoughts about the purpose of the work and the hoped achievements. Mijudging these contextual factors - especially the nature of the audience's needs - will endanger trustworthiness. Sometimes, matters of trust are outside the creator influence (cynism, prejudice and suspicion); generally speaking, people feel more confortable with visualisations that communicate data accordingly to their way of seeing the world. Also the chosen platform and/or location has an impact in trust (e.g. visualisations presented in already distrusted media).\n",
    " \n",
    " - *While working with data*: this is the starting moment where trustworthiness is built, in fact you are required to be faithful to the given raw data. Being honest about data handling is important (i.e. how was data collected, from where and under which criteria; eventual modifications and calculations applied to data; state the assumptions made or special counting rules used, if any; exclusion or removal of data; significance of results, biases that may distort interpretations.\n",
    " \n",
    " - *During the editorial thinking*: While you choose, as a creator, to do something you are of course choosing to not do something else. The decisions made on the chosen viewpoint is a subjective choice and for this reason may foster/endanger trustworthness.\n",
    " \n",
    " - *During the data representation*: You always have to keep in mind to not deceive the receiver: avoid misunderstandings, inaccuracices, confusions and distortions. There are many features of visualisation that can lead to deception (e.g., size of geometric areas may bring disproportions in the perception; 3D representation may distort data, for this reason 3 dimensions should only be used when 3 dimensions of data need to be displayed; bar chart value axis should never be truncated so that the origin value is always zero; aspect ratio of a line chart affects the perceived steepness of connecting lines and may distort the reading of trends over time; different projections may alter the perception of a thematic map distorting size/shape of regions; pie charts that add up to more or less than 100%).\n",
    " \n",
    " - *During the data presentation*: An important rule here is \"if it look significant it should be , otherwise you are misleading the viewer\". Undermining of trust may be caused by your decline to explain (e.g. absent annotations such as introductions/guides, axis titles and labels, footnotes, data sources that fail to inform the reader of what is going on; inconsistent/inappropriate colour usage; confusing/inaccessible layouts; reliability and consistency in the functional experience, especially in interactive projects, may have an impact in the thoroughness of delivered trust).\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " 2. **Accessible**: This principle is about helping to inform judgments about how best to facilitate the viewers through the process of understanding. Of course you cannot force viewers to understand but you can indeed smooth the way. In order to deliver accessibility you have ro remove design-related obstacles faced by your viewers when undertaking this process of understanding. In the viewer's perspective: he should experience minimum friction between the act of understanding (effort) and the achieving of understanding (reward). There's no formula, though, this friction minimisation depend on the context. One sure thing is that is not possibile to get all things right for every viewer. In any case, since visualisation is about human-centred design, showing empathy and putting them at the heart of decision making is essential. For example, what may help is knowing audience's knowledge and circumstances surrounding their consumption of the work.\n",
    " \n",
    "  **In the viewer's side**:\n",
    "  - **subject-matter appeal**: the appeal of the subject matter is a fundamental junction at the beginning of the consumption experience. Not being curious/interested about it could bring them to not put effort on it, viceversa, if the subject matter is appealing make users more likely to engange.\n",
    "  - **dynamic of need**: do they need to engage with the work or is it entirely volountary? maybe it concerns their job and this piece of information is needed to do their duties?\n",
    "  - **subject-matter knowledge**: what might the audience know and not know about this subject? what is their capacity to learn or potential motivation to develop their knowledge on this subject? A component of this, which blends existing knowledge with the capacity to acquire knowledge, concerns the distinctions between:\n",
    "     - *complicated*, these kind of subjects requires (acquirable) knowledge and skill but through time and effort, sometimes even with external guidance.\n",
    "     - *complex*, these kind of subjects are associated with something that have no definitive solutions, we could say that it is still in study.\n",
    "     - *simple*, these kind of subjects are inherently easy to undestand, regardless prior knowledge and experience.\n",
    "     - *simplified*, these subjects are complex or complicated in their nature, but details or nuances are eliminated in such a way that the subject is transformed in a reduced form.\n",
    "  Based on this, the creator should assess the kind of subject and find, according to the audience, a balance between complicated and simple, in order to avoid oversimplification.\n",
    "  - **what do they need to know?** it regards the mismatch between what your visualisation shows and what are the audience's expectations about it.\n",
    "  - **unfamiliar representation**: it regards 'visualisation literacy', there are a lot of way to visually portray data and it may be that the viewers are not able to read them, not because of a failure of them, but just because the lack of experience with these. Sometimes a deployment of an uncommon chart is seen as reasonable and appropriate - even the simplest way of portraying that subject - but still may be unfamiliar to the intended audience. This lack of pre-experience about the given visualisazion can be filled with 'how to read' guidance, but still, if the viewer feels overwhelmed or just unwilling to make the effort there's little you can do about it.\n",
    "  - **time**: at the moment of consumption is the viewer in a pressured situation with a lot at stake? Are viewers likely to be impatient and intolerant of the need to spend time learning how to read the display? Do they need quick insights or is there some capacity for them to explore/reading in depth? In the first case immediacy of information is crucial, in the second case complicated or complex can be presenting, even using unfamiliar chart types.\n",
    "  - **format**: In which kind of format your viewers need to consume your work? print output or digital? does it need to be compatible with small display? And what if the visualisation is consumed in a non-intended format?\n",
    "  - **personal tastes**: individual preferences about colours, visual elements, interaction features, etc.\n",
    "  - **attitued and emotion**: it regards the mood in which users approach the visualisation. Confidence is an extension of this, becuase sometimes users may feel unsufficiently equippee to engage a visualisation if the subject is uknown or if it pushes them outside their comfort zone.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   **In the author's side (what not to do)**:\n",
    "   - **your solution is useless**:\n",
    "     - when you fail to focus on relevant content\n",
    "     - when it is not deep enough, so you have provided a summary view of data when audience wanted further angles and greater depth\n",
    "     - oversimplification\n",
    "     - not fit for the setting (e.g., your work requires too much time with respect to what was needed)\n",
    "   - **your solution is obstrusive**:\n",
    "     - it is visually inaccessibile (e.g. no appreciation of potential impairments like colour blindness, the display includes bad interactive features)\n",
    "     - format is misjudged (e.g. you had to create a work for small-sized screen, but the solution was too detail-oriented and could not be easily read)\n",
    "     - it has too many functions, so you have failed to focus and provided a lot of interactive options, when the audience did not want to put such an effort\n",
    "   -**your solution is not understandable**:\n",
    "     - complex subject and complex analysis, so it was not clearly explained\n",
    "     - complex chart type, not enough explanation on how to read it, or did not consider whether the audience would have been capable of understanding or not\n",
    "     - absent annotations, it means insufficient details (e.g. scales, units, descriptions, etc.)\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Elegant**: Elegant design is about seeking to achieve a visual quality that is attractive in a sustained way (from the beginning to the end of the engagement). This is the last principle because it has not to be undermine the previous ones. When thinking about the pursuit of elegance, some words that could be linked are: stylish, dignified, effortless and graceful. It is important that visual quality attract your audience without letting the style overcome the substance.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **Pursuing Elegance**:\n",
    "  - *eliminate the arbitrary*. Even if there is not a scientific or theoretical bases of your choices, you should always be able to offer reasons behind what is included and excluded.\n",
    "  - *thoroughness*. You will to agonise over the smallest details and pixel-inaccuracies, that is in order to show respect for your audience.\n",
    "  - *style*. Developing a style is in many ways a manifestation of elegant design (according to Thomas Clever). The decisions around colour selection, typography and composition are all matters that influence your style. Having style guides helps navigating through design thinking, that is because it foster consistency and create efficiency, without having to think each time at choices from scratch: so more space is left for thinking about what to show and not how to show.\n",
    "  - *decorations should be additive, not negative*. Decorations should be the intersection between useful and beauty, but it is mandatory, while embellishing, to preserve the communicative value.\n",
    "  - *not about minimalism*. Elegant design should be invisible, in the sense that a viewer should be able to see the content, but not the design itself. This has not to be confused with minimalism though."

    "## Data Visualisation Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Kirk, The process of creating a visualisation generally follows the Pareto principle: 20% of decisione made have implications for about 80% of the final visible design.\n",
    "Since there so perfection in data visualisation, at least not in real life, we should fell unburden from the sense that we were not able to find the perfect solution. Despite this, we should strive for the best - instead of the worse - solution, the optimum one. In order to achieve this, we are required to improve effectiveness and efficiency. And we can do it by following a design process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How should a design process be\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pragmatic**: this process aims to provide a framework for thinking, not instructions for learning. Even if dogmatism may appear comfortable, since it give us straightforward indications on what to do, flexible pragmatism has to be considered always better than dogmatism, especially thinking at the fact that there is no unversal rule to blindly rely upon.\n",
    "- **Reducing the randomness of your approach**: The real value of the process is to have a guide for where and how to begin and finish your work. Especially as a beginner, the amount of things to think about can be overwhelming; for this reason,breaking down the activities in a connected system of thinking helps to organise and preserve choesion over the activities.\n",
    "- **Protect experimentation**: The approach is systematic, but it does not mean squeezing out creativity and experimentation. Is important to reduce wasted effort, but it is also vital to follow your imagination. Often your work will not rely on creative inputs, especially in case of time constraints.\n",
    "- **Facilitate adaptability and iteration**: this process has to be seen as a design one rather than a procedure. In fact, a good process facilitate the adaptability and remove the inflexibility of a defined procedure of operations. A good process function as a cushion for situations in which revisions or changes are needed.\n",
    "- **The first occasion, not the last**: It is important to note that the faced tasks during each stage in the process are the first occasion to pay attention to them, not the final one; a continuous interaction is needed.\n",
    "- **Always the same process**: Even if you are producing the same work every month, there are no projects providing exactly the same experience. But the process you follow will always require the same activities in the same sequence, regardless of everything else (size, time and complexity).\n",
    "- **Partitioning your mindset**: within each sequence are required different kind of mindset:\n",
    " - *thinking*. Conceptual, it requires imagination and judgment (i.e. formulating your curiosity, defining your audience's needs, reasoning your editorial perspectives and making decisions about viable design choices).\n",
    " - *doing*. Practical, it still engage the brain, but requires more hands-on activities (i.e. sketching ideas and concepts, learning about a subject through research, gathering and handling data).\n",
    " - *making*. Constructive and technical activities that relate to the production cycle (i.e. translating promising, well-considered design concepts into effective, working solutions).\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### The process in practice\n",
    "\n",
    "- **managing progress and resources**: good planning, time and resource management keep a process cohesive and progressing, they are the lubricant. It is very uncommon to work on a project without deadlines, for this reason is important to self-regulate themselves on timing. Especially data gathering and production cycle may appear as never ending steps. Recognising the need to factor in time for some of the broader responsibilities will be beneficial at the end.\n",
    "- **room to think**: being in an 'alpha' brain state helps to heighten imagination, learning and thought process. This state is typical of relaxed situations. Taking into account the whole available time, it is useful to leave some of it to let your brain 'enter' in that state and give it the opportunity to form good ideas.\n",
    "- **heuristic to support decisions**: when the best choice does not present itself you may rely on heuristic techniques that help in speeding the process of decision-making. It may happear as an unsatisfactory tactic, but since aribtrary choices have to be avoided, heuristics can remain consistent with this desire when they rely on educated, intuitive or common-sense judgments.\n",
    "- **pen and paper**: capturing ideas and creating sketches are a critical part of the process. This is not about art, you just need to get things out of your head and onto paper. It does not have to be pen and paper, any other medium that allow you to sketch ideas quickly is perfectly fine.\n",
    "- **note-taking**: this is about preserving records of important details:\n",
    " - info about the sources of data\n",
    " - calculations or manipulations applied to data\n",
    " - assumptions made\n",
    " - data descriptions\n",
    " - questions that still need an answer\n",
    " - eventual answers got to the previous questions\n",
    " - terminology and abbreviations\n",
    " - task lists and wish lists of features and ideas you are considering\n",
    " - forseen issues or problems\n",
    " - sources that gave you inspiration\n",
    " - ideas you have had or rejected\n",
    "- **communication**: communication is a two-way activity:\n",
    " - listening to stakeholders and your audience -> what they explicitly want, their expectations, ideas they have, knowledge they have about the subject.\n",
    " - speaking to others -> presenting ideas, updating on progress, seeking feedback, sharing thoughts about possible solutions, promoting and selling your work.\n",
    "- **research**: this is a constant all along your process of thinking. You cannot know anything about the chosen subject, the meaning of data and the relevant - and irrelevant - quantities it has. Data itself can only tell so much, often it just tell where interesting things might exist, not what actually explains why they are interesting.\n",
    "- **attention to details**: you cannot carry any errors in your work. Having this commitment in mind allows you to secure trust in your work. Even if in front of small stuff, each decision deserve full attention. If you cannot manage to do that yourself, ask for others help.\n",
    "- **make it work for you**: the only way to find out whether a process works for you is practising it. The process proposed by Kirk may not fit everyone, so it can be bended and stretched.\n",
    "- **be honest with yourself**: honesty is vital, especially if you are working alone. Being blind to things that are not working or avoid considering constructive feedback because of the invested effort is going to be destructive.\n",
    "- **learn**: reflective learning is about looking back to what you did, examining the output and evaluating the approach. Beyond private reflections, in the Web is possibile to find narratives about the design process behind a data visualisation."

    "# The Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "## STAGE 1. Formulating your brief\n",
    "\n",
    "This stage is about identifying the contex in which your work will be undertaken and then define its aims (who, what, why, where, when and how).\n",
    "A brief represents the set of expectations and it captures all the relevant information about a task or project. If you are working with others it will be a shared interest to have a grasp on the projects' requirements. If you are working alone, you will not have been issued with any brief, but it will still be an advantage to compile it for yourself (it may be a simple checklist). While you are willing to play with data and focus on creativity, this step may seem frustrating, but understanding contextual matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In formulating yoru brief, you should establish **context** and **vision**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Context\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.a. define your origin curiosity\n",
    "\n",
    "A worthwile data visualisation project starts from curiosity. Curiosity can be defined as the possession of a strong desire to know or learn something, which incidentally is also aligned to the goal of data visualisation: a facilitation to understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 5 possible scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *personal*: questions raised by yourself\n",
    "- *stakeholder*: questions raised by someone else (no anticipation of interest)\n",
    "- *audience*: combination of knowing what will be needed and anticipating what could be needed\n",
    "- *anticipated*: audience did not explicitly ask for and is not needed, but is perceived to be relevant\n",
    "- *potential*: opportunity of exploration without exactly knowing where to go\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.b. identify your project's circumstances\n",
    "\n",
    "This involves identifying all the requirements and restrictions that are inherited by you, imposed on you or determined by you. Even if some factors may not be relevant or not have any restrictions or set requirements, may be useful to impose self restrictions in order to focus better.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **People**\n",
    " - *Stakeholders*: when you are requested/commissioned to do a visualisation it is helpful to establish an understanding of all the players and their involvement. Defining stakeholders will help anticipating the kind of experience you are going through, how enjoyable or smooth it might be, or how much friction and what kind of obstacles might be involved.\n",
    " - *Audience*: what are the characteristics of your viewers? You want to understand their relationship with the subject, how much are they informed about the subject and what motivation they might have about it.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "- **Constraints**:\n",
    " - *pressures*:\n",
    "   - the primary pressure is *time*, how much time do you have. But the real issue is the relationship between time and the estimated duration of your work. Estimating project duration is difficult though and a lot of experience in different projects is needed in order to know how much time each task could take. But even similar projects can end up with different tasks duration, also in front of slight changes.\n",
    "   - you need to be aware of any other *milestones* that might have to be met; when you are producing for other stakeholders you may be required to present your ideas and progress, and this is good because you have the opportunity to check whether you are in sync or not with the needs.\n",
    "   - *financial restrictions*\n",
    "   - *market influences*, which is competing for attention of others work.\n",
    "   \n",
    " - *rules*: these are concerned with any design rules you need to know about and follow:\n",
    "   - layout/size restrictions: maximum size and specific shape restriction (articles published in journals) or screen size dimensions (digital outputs). Are there printing requirements around dpi? the common standard for printing is 300 dpi.\n",
    "   - style guidelines, in many organisation there are visual identitfy branding guides imposed on you that determine colours, typeface, logos, etc. It may be worth trying to push those restrictions back if are unnecessary or bad-suited to data visualisation.\n",
    "   - functional restrictions, the potential requirement to create outputs that are compatible with certain browsers, versions of software or programming languages.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Consumption**:\n",
    " - *frequency*: it concerns how often a project will be repeated and what its lifespan is. It can be regular (e.g. monthly report) or irregular (e.g. election polling update after each release). The cost-benefit ratio has to be taken into account; also if you can invest time and energy in programmatically automating certain parts of the creation process or not; what is the trad-off between amount of work and the expiry of its relevance as time passes.\n",
    " - *setting*: it concerns the situation in which your work is going to be consumed. Four type of settings:\n",
    "   - boardroom: characterised by limited time, immediate insights required and key message must be at glance.\n",
    "   - coffee shop: more relaxed, a setting that may be compatible with something more involving and requiring the viewers to spend more time learning about the subject, familiarising themselves with how to read the display and discovering the different parts of the content.\n",
    "   - cockpit: it realates to the natural setting of visualisation. There is a need for immediate signals to stand out at a glance but also offering sufficient breadth and depth to serve a multitude of different potential interests.\n",
    "   - prop: a visualisation in this setting plays the role of supporting a presenter (in a talk) or a writer (reports and articles).\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Deliverables**:\n",
    " - *quantity*: it concerns establishing the project's workload in a quantity perspective. How many things are you making? How much, what shape and size? Does it involve different angles of analysis or a narrower and focused view of the data?\n",
    " - *format*: it concerns the output format (digital, print or phyisical). Is it intended as a large poster-sized print or a standard A4-sized report? Website, video, tool or app? Is the digital output intended for smartphone and tablet as well as dekstop?\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Resources**:\n",
    " - *skills*: What capabilities exist among those who are going to play in the design process?\n",
    " - *technology: What tools/app/programming options will you use?\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.c. define your project's purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This is about thinking to the intended destination, so on what you specifically hope to accomplish through the visualisation.\n",
    "The goal is always the same: facilitate understanding. But the nature of this understanding may vary.\n",
    "So, if the *perceiving* step is determined by the accessibility of the design and the *interpreting* step is determinated by the viewer's capacity to derive meaning and/or by the visualiser providing explanatory assistance, this final step of *comprehending* is largely determined by the viewer alone, it fully depends on what he knows, its beliefs and intentions for acquiring this understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**possible choices**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A visualisation might aim to be impactive trying to shock or inspire viewers in order to persuade them about behavioural changes or decisions taking.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A visualisation might aim to enlighten or simply inform viewers better about a subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, there is no single type of visualisation that will be capable of delivering an experience whereby all flavours of understanding are facilitated. It is important to state that purpose must be defined after having established your trigger curiosity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Vision\n",
    "\n",
    "Aftering having defined curiosity, circumstances and purpose is useful to supplement this contextual thinking with the formation of an initial vision for your work. The definition of vision is \"the ability to think about or plan the future with imagination or wisdom\", and it is particularly relevant for achieving the purpose stated at the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.a. the purpose map\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, two of the most significant characteristics of a visualisations are **tone** and **experience**.\n",
    "Certain types of visualisation will offer a better fit for your project and their characteristics in term of tone and experience will offer the right blend to best connect your origin curiosity with the purpose. Each dimension and region within the purpose map has its own meaning and significance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Experience**: the horizontal dimension of this map concerns the experience of the visualisation (how will it practically operate as a means of communcation? Through what functional experience will understanding be achieved by the viewer?) Along this spectrum there are three different states:\n",
    " - **Explanatory**, provide the viewer with a visual portrayal of the subject's data and take some responsibility to bring key insights to the surface, rather than leaving to the viewer the whole process of interpreting the information. The visualiser is attempting to assist with the viewer' process of understanding as much as possible, in particular with respect to the interpretation, drawing out the meaning of the data. There are different form of explanatory visualisation:\n",
    "   - *annotate & describe*: this is the mildest form of explanation, in these kind of projects there are simple annotation devices like value labels or visual guides that assists the viewer while interpreting the data. The use of colour can be an immediate visual cue that help separating features of a chart. Also captions may be used to outline a key message or to summary finding. Usually these kind of visualisations are self-explanatory without any need of further explanations.\n",
    "   - *sequence & drama*: the experience here is an intensive attempt to enlighten an audience's understanding of a subject. This could possibily be through the use of a narrative strucutred around a sequence of information and/or dramatic experience. This kind of work is characterised by videos or presentations, maybe an animated or motion graphic.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Across all explanatory visualisations, the visualiser will require sufficient knowledge about the shown topic in order to identify the most relevant, interesting and worthwile insights to present to the viewer. Explanatory visualisations are the best-fit solution when the context dictates that saying nothing is not sufficient.\n",
    "   \n",
    "  - **Exploratory**: with respect to explanatory visualisations these are focused more on helping the viewer/user find their own insights. Often these types of works will be digital and interactive.\n",
    "   - *manipulate & interrogate*, the mildest form of exploratory works are those that facilitate interrogation and manipulation of the data (modify the view of the chart, highlight/filter certain categories of interest, change data parameters, switch between different views). You might be able to hover over different features to reveal detailed annotations. This will be suitable if the intended audince have the necessary foundation knowledge for the subject and sufficient interest to translate the general and personal meaning. These kind of visualisation may contain no captions, indications of what is significant or insignificant, no assistance to form meaning through the use of colours or markers to emphasise good or bad values.\n",
    "   - *participate & contribute*, these kind of visualisations are bringing a far deeper exploratory experience. For users it is hard to resist to the possibility of make sense of their place in the world (e.g. how my salary do compare with others, how well do I know the area where I live, etc.).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The biggest obstacle to the success of exploratory visualisations is the \"so what?\" factor. If the reactions arising are \"what do you want me to do with project\", \"why is it relevant\" or \"what am I supposed to get out of this\" there is a clear disconnect between your projects' intentions and the experience (or the expectations) of the audience.\n",
    " \n",
    " - **Exhibitory**: these kind of visualisations are characterised by being neither explicitly explanatory nor exploratory. Here the viewer has to do all the work to interpret meaning, relying on their own capacity to make sense of data and the context of the subject. These lack explanatory qualities and also do not offer any scope for exploratory interrogation. These are just visual displays of data, it is like exhibiting an artwork: the viewer has to be able to understand the content and the context. It is easy to fall under this category of visualisation unappropriately, often visualisations are published as exhibitory but actually these would be way better if explanatory. This kind of visualisation is for a very specific audience, they should be sufficiently knowledgeable about the domain and the analysis you provide.\n",
    " \n",
    "   As general features, these kind of visualisations do not provide exploration, interaction or explanations.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Tone**: the vertical dimension of the purpose map concerns the intended tone of the visualisation. Differently from the experience dimension, the tone is a continuum with subtle variations between the two opposites (reading and feeling).\n",
    " - **reading tone**: the tone should be oriented to optimising the ease with which viewers can accurately estimate the magnitude of and relationships between values. There is emphasis on the efficiency of perceiving data. The reading tone is your best-fit approach when the purpose of your work requires to facilitate understanding with precision and detail. This would also be relevant in situations when there is no need to seduce the audience. It also suits the needs well when the subject does not inherently embody any form of visual stimulation to convey the essence of the message more potently. The visual quality created with this tone might be considered analytical, pragmatic, without frills. Bar charts are typical for this kind of display.\n",
    " - **feeling tone**: The lower end of this vertical dimension offers a contrasting tone of voice to that of reading. Sometimes your aim is not that of providing a precise display, maybe you would just like to give a greater importance on the feeling of your data. At this side of the spectrum there is more emphasis placed on determining the essence of big, medium and small values and a general sense of the relationships that exist. Visual forms of data offer a more revealing and efficient way to understand the quantities and relationships that exist within data, something that you cannot achieve properly through non-visual forms; so you are trying to look for something more and different from what a table of data can offer. While a bar chart can suffice, sometimes you might need something even more different. Sometimes you want to employ an aesthetic seduction: create an appealing form that attracts viewers and encourages them to engage with a subject they might not have otherwise found relevant. This could involve a novel visual look that attracts and informs or a functional feature that attracts but also performs. The influence of fun cannot be underestimated. In real case scenario, viewers may build interst over the subject after having engaged the visualisation, and not before, just based on the starting perceived interest. Sometimes the subject itself has the potential to stimulate strong emotions. Depending on the purpose of your work there might be good reason to encapsulate and exploit these emotions through your visualisation in a way that bar chart simply may not be able to achieve. By pushing to an emotion you might be able to influence how your viewer experience the stages of understanding and comprehending: so it can be considered as manipulation to a certain degree. But, as long as you are faithful to data, this can still be considered appropriate.\n",

    "#### 2.b. harnessing ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the phase of earliest seeds of any ideas you may have in mind for what this solution might comprise or look like. These maybe mental manifestations of ideas you have formed yourself or influenced or inspired by what you have seen somewhere else.\n",
    "Let us see some of the aspects of harnessing ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **mental visualisation**, this is about embracing what we istinctively see in our mind's eye when considering the emerging brief for our task. Kahneman talks about System 1 and System 2 of thinking, where the first one is responsible for our instinctive, intuitive and metaphorical thoughts, while the second one is much more ponderous, slower and requiring more mental effort. System 1 thinkig is what you want to harness in this phase. Some questions that may let System 1 overcome System 2 are: What colours do you see? What shapes and patterns strike you as being semantically aligned with the subject?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **keywords**, this is about the language that come to mind when thinking about the subject or the phenomena of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **sketching**, as well as taking notes, sketching ideas is useful. This is not about being an artist, but just to have the opportunity to be free and fast while extracting ideas from mind to paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **reasearch & inspirations**, it is important to be open to influence and inspiration from what surrounds you. You can achieve this exposing yourself to different sources. Research the techniques that are being used around the visualisation field, look through books and see how others tackled similar subjects. Other than visualisation, consider any source of imagery that inspires you (e.g. colours, patterns, shapes, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **limitations of your ideas (as an author)**, while the desire of emulation is understandable, plagiarism, copying and stealing uncredited ideas is wrong. Sometimes is hard to establish the boundarie between influence and plagiarism, and this is typical of any creative discipline. But if you do incorporate explicit ideas influenced by others you should credit the authors or even seek them and ask them for their approval.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **limitations of others' ideas**, when you are working with stakeholders, especially if you arrive after ideas have already been formed, your creative process may be undermined. It is up to your communication skills to be able to still lead on the creation process and eventually guide it away from early concepts."

    "## STAGE 3. Establishing your editorial thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the phase in which you need to start to commit to a definitive pathway. The gathered data during the phase 2 was shaped by your trigger curiosity. But, before starting the design and development of your solution you need to decide what you are going to do with this data (i.e., what are you going to show to your audience). This is where editorial thinking becomes important.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is **editorial thinking**?\n",
    "\n",
    "The essence of it is demonstrating a discerning eye for what you are going to potray visually to your audience, the \"how\" step is afterwards. Taking words from photojournalism, there are three perspectives to consider here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **angle**, as it is in photography, in visualisation you cannot show everything at once. A 360° view is impossibile to display, and for sure not in a single chart, you have to pick an angle. In visualisation, it refers to the angle of analysis you intend to show (e.g., what are you measuring and bh which dimension are you breaking it down; are you going to show product sales over time, how are they organised by regions, or how they compare on a map and over time?). Also, using multiple charts you could potray different angles. When thinking to an angle to choose you should consider if it is:\n",
    " - **relevant**, why is it worth to show your data from this angle and not another one? why this angle is going to offer the most relevant window into the subject for your intended audience? While thinking at relevance you should think about:\n",
    "    - what does your intended audience want or need to know? Often it is useful to refer to your audience's profile and the contextual circumstances. Sometimes it may be useful to create personas: a small number of imagined identities that may be demographically representative  of the types of viewer you expect to target.\n",
    "    - What makes something relevant in your context? You should consider whether relevance is a product of the normal or the exceptional. In fact, often the worthiness of an item of news is based on it being exceptional rather than going through the repeated reporting of normality. Do not hope that someone is going to find it relevant.\n",
    "    - What do you want your audience to know? You should definitely take into account your audience's needs, but you might actually be better placed to determine what is truly relevant. Depending on the context, and on your proximity to the subject and its data, you might have the autonomy to decide what you want to say, more than what the audience want to see. In fact, audience may not know or not be sufficiently domain aware to determine what is relevant and what is not.\n",
    " - **sufficient**, this is about judging how many angles you need. Is a chart offering a single angle into your data sufficient in regard of what you want to potray? You cannot portray anything in one chart, maybe you need multiple charts offering multiple angles to sufficiently represent the most intersting dimension of the subject. Even in a small dataset, it is pretty common to find yourself willing to show multiple angles and it is hard to ignore this temptation. But it is important to understand that throwing more and more angles in will automatically enrich your work. Finding just the right number of angles to show the core of your curiosity is the real art.\n",
    " \n",
    "2. **framing**, This is about the refinement of the angles you have selected (the field of view). It is useful to ask yourself which data to include and to exclude: all category values or just a selection? All quantitative values or just those over a threshold? All data or just those between a defined start and end date period? Answering to these questions is influenced by your trigger curiosity and also the complexity of the subject and the amount of data available. One key element of framing is to remove unnecessary clutter: there is only a certain quantity that can be fitted in a single view before it becomes too busy, too detailed and too small in resolution; also in the viewer's perspective there is just a limited quantity of content your audience will likely be willing and able to process. If you zoom-in, filtering away too much of the content might hide the important context required for perceiving values; conversely, if you avoid filtering your content you may fail to make visible the most salient discoveries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **focus**, This is about what you might choose to focus on, rather than filtering, it is emphasising what is more important in constrast to what is less important. Whereas framing were about reducing clutter, this is about reducing noise. Decisions about focus primarily concern the development of explanatory visualisations, because creating such a focus is a key purpose for that type of experience."

    "## STAGE 4. Developing your design solution\n",
    "\n",
    "This stage follows a production cycle, commencing with rationalising design ideas and moving through the development of a final solution. It is a cycle since there are many loops of iteration as you evolve between conceptually, practical and technical thinking. There are several discrete steps involved in this production cycle (e.g., conceiving ideas across the five layers of visualisation design; wireframing and storyboarding design; developing prototypes or mock-up versions; testing; refining and completing; launching the solution).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first and most significant layer of the visualisation design anatomy and it is concerned with deciding in what visual form you wish to show your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As viewers, when we are perceiving a visual display of data we are **decoding** the various shapes, sizes, positions and colours to form an understanding of the quantitative and categorical values represented. As visualisers we are doing the reverse process of **encoding**, that is assigning visual properties to data values. Visual encoding is the basis of any data representation, along with the components that help completing the chart display.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different way to encode data, but we can say that data encoding is always a combination of marks and attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **marks**, are visible features like dots, lines and areas. An individual mark can represent a record of instance of data, it can also represent an aggregation of records or instances. A set of marks would therefore represent a set of records or instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **attributes**, are variations applied to the appearence of marks, such as the size, position, or colour. They are used to represent the values held by different quantitative or categorical variables against each record, instance or aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of visual encoding is to find the right blend of marks and attributes that most effectively will portray the angle of analysis you wish to show your viewers. Let us see the range of different marks and attributes that are commonly found in the data representation toolkit:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **kind of marks**:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **point**: the point mark has no variation (is constant) in the spatial dimension. It is largely a placeholder commonly used to represent a quantity through position on a scale, forming the basis of, for example, scatter plots.\n",
    " - **line**: the line mark has one (linear) spatial dimension. It is commonly used to represent quantitative value through variation in size, forming the basis of, for example, the bar chart.\n",
    " - **area**: the area mark has two (quadratic) spatial dimensions. It is commonly used to represent quantitative values through variation in size and position, forming the basis of, for example, bubble plots.\n",
    " - **form**: the form mark has three (cubic) spatial dimensions. It might be used to represent quantitative values through variation in size (specifically through volume), forming the basis of, for example, a 3D proportional shape chart.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "- **kind of attributes**:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **quantitative ones**:\n",
    "   - **position**: position along a scale is used to indicate a quantitative value.\n",
    "   - **size**: size (length, area, volume) is used to represent quantitative values based on proportional scales where the larger the size of the mark, the larger the quantity.\n",
    "   - **angle/slope**: variation in the size of angle forms the basis of pie chart sectors representing parts-of-a-whole quantitative values; the larger the angle, the larger the proportion. The slope of an incline formed by angle variation can also be used to encode values.\n",
    "   - **quantity**: the quantity of a repeated set of point marks can be used to represent a one-to-one or a one-to-many unit count.\n",
    "   - **colour saturation**: it can be used (often in conjunction with other colour properties) to represent quantitative scales; tipically, the greater the saturation, the higher the quantity.\n",
    "   - **colour lightness**: it can be used (often in conjunction with other colour properties) to represent quantitative scales; typically the darker the colour, the higher the quantity.\n",
    "   - **pattern**: variation in pattern density or difference in pattern texture can be used to represent quantitative scales or distinguish between categorical ordinal states.\n",
    "   - **motion**: motion is more rarely seen but it could be used as a binary indicator to draw focus (motion vs no motion) or by incorporating movement through speed and direction to represent a quantitative scale ramp).\n",
    "   \n",
    " - **categorical ones**:\n",
    " \n",
    "   - **symbol/shape**: symbols or shapes are generally used with points markers to indicate categorical association.\n",
    "   - **colour hue**: it is typically used for distinguishing different categorical data values but can also be used in conjunction with other colour properties to represent certain quantitative scales.\n",
    "   \n",
    " - **relational attributes**:\n",
    " \n",
    "   - **connection/edge**: A connection or edge indicates a relationship between two nodes. Sometimes arrows may be added to indicate direction of relationship, but largely it is just about the presence or absence of a connection.\n",

    "### Influencing Factors and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are going to consider the general factors that will influence your specific choices for which chart or charts to use for your data representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, let us see the relevant factors that emerge from the first three preparatory stages of the design process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **while FORMULATING YOUR BRIEF (stage 1)**:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **skills and resources, frequency**: think about what charts can you actually make and how efficiently can you create them. Having the ability to create a broad repertoire of chart types is the vocabulary of data visualisation, to have the ability to judge when use them is the literacy. What have a great influence is the expressiveness of your abilities and that of the technology you have access to, Expressiveness refers to the amount of variety and extent of control you are provided with by a given technology in the construction of your visualisation solution as long as you also possess thet necessary skills:\n",
    " \n",
    "   - **maximum expressiveness** means that you are able to create any combination of mark and attribute encoding to display your data. You can create many different charts.\n",
    "   - **restricted expressiveness** means that you have much more limited scope to adapt different mark and attribute encodings. You might be faced with assigning data to the fixed encoding options afforded by a modest menu of chart types. For instance, Excel has a limited range of chart types in its possibilities; there are of course ways of enhancing the options through plugins and workaround, but still it is a limited tool. Depending on the context it may be sufficient.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   It may be useful to be able to score your ability to perform a certain chart through a score system:\n",
    "     - 3: charts you can personally create relatively easily\n",
    "     - 2: charts you can make but involve a great amount of time and effort\n",
    "     - 1: charts you can get collaborators or colleagues to create for you\n",
    "     - 0: charts you might not be able to create at all\n",
    "     \n",
    " - **purpose**: should you represent your data in chart form? Will it add value, enabling new insights or greater perceptual efficiency compared with its non-visualised form? Will portraying your data just via a presented table offer a more suitable solution? Would it be better to display it through information-based (rather than data-based) explanations using imagery, textual anecdotes, video and photos? When thinking of charting, always make sure you are adding value.\n",
    " - **purpose map**: In the defining the tone of your project you were determining what the optimum perceptibility of your data would be for your audience. Your definitions were based on facilitating the reading of data or giving a general feeling of data? Were you concerned with enabling precise and accurate perceptions of values or just a sense about big, medium and small? Were the emotional qualities that you wanted to emphasise at the compromise of perceptual efficiency or they were balanced?\n",
    " \n",
    "   How these tonal definitions apply specifically to data representation requires some theory about data visualisation; based on previous studies (Bertin 1967, Cleveland and McGill 1984, Mackinlay 1986) it appears that certain attributes used to encode data may make it easier, and others may make it harder, to judge accurately the values being portrayed. For example, judging variations in lines is far more precise than in areas, even worse in circles and this is due to the 2D measure and the shape.\n",
    "   Let us see Mackinlay's ranking of perceptual tasks (for each category, higher is easier to estimate):\n",

    "   \n",
    "- **while WORKING WITH DATA (stage 2)**:\n",
    " - **data examination**: the physical characteristics of your data are especially influential. What types of data your are trying to display will impact on how you are able to show them. Only certain types of data can fit into certain chart types and only certain chart types can accomodate certain types of data.\n",
    " - **data exploration**: One useful pointer towards how you might visually communicate your data to others is to consider which techniques helped you to unearth key insights when you were visually exploring the data. Exploratory data analyisis is a bridge to visual communication: the charts you use to inform yourself often represent prototype thinking on how much you might communicate with others.\n",
    " \n",
    "- **while ESTABLISHING YOUR EDITORIAL THINKING (stage 3)**:\n",
    " - **angle**: when articulating the angles of analysis you are dictating which chart types might be most relevant. By expressing your desired editorial angles of analysis in language terms, yhis will be extremely helpful in identifying the primary families of charts across the CHRTS taxonomy providing the best option. It is vital to treat every representation challenge on its own merit, for example, just because you have spatial data it does not mean you have to portray it via a map; in fact, if the interesting insights are not regionally and spatially significant, then the map may not provide the most relevant window on that data.\n",
    " - **trustworthy design**:\n",
    "   Being truthful and avoiding deception in how you portray data visually are fundamental obligations. There are many ways in which viewers can be deceived through incorrect and inappropriate encoding choices. The main issue araound deception concern encoding the size of quantities:\n",
    "     - *geometric calculations*: when using the area of shapes to represent different quantitative values, the underlying geometry needs to be calculated accurately. One of the common mistakes when using circles, for example, is simply to modify the diameter. That geometric approach is a mistake, because when perceiving the size of a circle, it is the area rather than its width that it is used to estimate quantitative values.\n",
    "     - *3D decorations*: In most cases 3D charts are unnecessary, or they are even distorting the display of data. Using pseudo-3D effects when data is just 2D means you are distorting the viewer's ability to read values with accuracy.\n",

    "## Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition is about making careful decision about the physical attributes of, and relationships between, every visual property to ensure the optimum readability and meaning of the overall, cohesive project. This is the final layer of your design anatomy, not the least important though.\n",
    "\n",
    "This topic may be divided into:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Project composition**: defining the layout and the hierarchy of the project\n",
    "- **Chart composition**: sdefining the shape, size and layout choices for all the components within the chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project composition\n",
    "\n",
    "Where will you put all the elements, what size will they be and why? How will the hierarchy and sequencing best fit the space you have to work in? How will you convey the relative importance and provide a connected narrative where necassary?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth to emphasise that, even if there are some established conventions, most of composition thinking is about common sense and it involves a process of iteration towards what feels like an optimum layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hierarchy of content is not just a function of relative position through layout design, it can also be achieved through the relative variation in size of the contents. Just as variation in colour implies significance, also variation in size does: if a chart is larger than another it means that is more important.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two approaches for shaping your ideas about this project-level composition activity, depending on your entry-point perspective:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **wireframing**: sketching the potential layout and size of all the major contents of your design thinking across a single-page view.\n",
    "- **storyboarding**: it is paired with wireframing if the project is multipage or if it has many different views and you want to establish a high-level feel for the overall architecture of content, its navigation and sequencing. The individual page views included as cells in the big-picture hierarchy will each merit more detailed wireframing versions to determine how their within-page content will be sized and arranged, and how the navigation between views would operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both wireframing and storyboarding are low-fidelity sketched concepts. The purpose of this is to capture with moderate precision the essence of your early thinking about the spatial consequence of bringing your design choices together. Through further iteration the precision of the solution is going to emerge.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chart composition\n",
    "\n",
    "After establishing your thoughts about the overall layout, you will need to go deeper in the composition thinking and contemplate the detailed spatial matters local to each chart, to optimise its legibility and meaning. There are different components to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **chart size**: A viewer is able to detect attributes at small resolution and with great efficiency. This to say that small-multiples technique is a good approach. This is particularly good when you are trying to display the same analysis for multiple categories or multiple points in time. Providing all the information in a simultaneous view allows the viewer to observe overall patterns and perform a detailed inspection. The main obstacle while shrinking chart is the impact on text, small fonts for value or category labels may be a problem; there has to be a trade-off between the amount of detail and the size.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **chart scales**: When considering your chart-scales try to think about how you might use these to tell the viewer something meaningful. This can be achieved throguh wise choices around the maximum value ranges and also through the choice of suitable intervals for labelling and gridline guides. The maximum value you  assign to your chart scales can be impactful in surfacing key insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **chart orientation**: orientation of your chart and its contents can help squeeze out an extra degree of readability and meaning from your display. The primary issue about chart orientation is the legibility of labels along the axis. For example, a vertical bar chart with multiple categories along the x-axis may cause a problem to read its labels, maybe because overalapping. The meaning of your subject's data may also influence your choice (e.g. split of political parties)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **chart value sorting**: sorting content within a chart is important for helping viewers to find and compare quickly the most relevant content. One of the best ways to consider the options for value sorting comes from the **LATCH** acronym (Location, Alphabet, Time, Category, Hierarchy).\n",
    " - *Location*: sorting content according to the order of a spatial dimension. You should order by location only when you believe it offers the most logical sequence for the readability of the display or if there is likely to be interest or significance in the comparison of neighbouring values.\n",
    " \n",
    " - *Alphabet*: cataloguing approach that facilitates efficient lookup and reference. When you want to offer convenient ordering for looking up categorial values, you will find alphabetical sorting as the best possibile order. Alphabetical sorting might be a diplomatic solution when you do not want to imply any kind of ranking significance. Alphabetical ordering is useful for values listed in dropdown menus as it is the most immediate way to quickly find the option you - as a viewer - are interested in selecting.\n",
    " \n",
    " - *Time*: this is used when data has a relevant chronological sequence and when you wish to display and compare how things have progressed over time.\n",
    " \n",
    " - *Category*: it can be useful with sequence of categories that have logical hierarchy implied by their values or unique to the subject matter.\n",
    " \n",
    " - *Hierarchy*: it organises data by increasing or decreasing quantities so a viewer can perceive the size, distribution and underlying ranking of values in an efficient way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Influencing factors and considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "This is about weighting your decisions on how you might employ these in your own work. Here are some of the specific factors to take into account:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **format**: as composition is about spatial arrangement, the nature and dimensions of the canvas you work with have a specific weight on the decision you make. What will be the shape and size of the primary format and how transferable will your solution be across different platforms on which it might be used or consumed? Another factor is the mobility of viewing your work. If the form of your output enables viewers to move a display or move around a display in a circular plane there is not going to be any problem with label orientation. On the contrary, if the output is going to be consumed in a fixed scenario, the flexibility of viewing positions will be restricted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **data examination**: the shape and size of your data will influence your chart composition decisions. Sometimes changes in scale can be made in order to make data fit into your canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **chart type choice**: different charts have different spatial consequences. For instance, a treemap occupies more space that a pie chart; a polar chart is circular, whereas a waffle chart is squared. With each chart you include you will have a uniquely shaped piece that will form part of the overall visualisation. It may be needed to do some shuffling of content in order to find the right size and placement balance. Let us see the main chart structures and the typical shape they occupy:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Cartesian**: these are effective rectangular structures based on a coordinate system with magnitudes or positions along an x (horizontal) and y (vertical) dimension. *Bar charts* and *line charts* use this structure.\n",
    "  - **Spatial**: These are mapping projections used to display thematic mapping, where values are plotted according to longitude-latitude or associated with the polygonal shapes of geographic units.\n",
    "  - **Radial**: Radial structures are characterised by a central or circular layout usually based on the division of angular parts or axes radiating outwards. They are used for polar and pie charts. Certain hierarchical and relational charts also demonstrate a similar graphical structure, whereby concentric layers or nodes and edges emanate from a natural centre. For example, *node-link diagrams* use this structure.\n",
    "  - **Columnar**: These structures are associated with table-like layouts based on associated x and y cell positions (like the *heat map*) or layouts that have different tiers or states (such as the *Sankey diagram* or the *linear dendrogram*).\n",
    "  - **Enclosure**: Enclosure charts are based around a fixed shaped container whithin which data is arranged optimally. This would be seen in the *treemap* and the *waffle chart*.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **chart-scale optimisation**: decisions about the maximum, minimum and interval choiches that ensure integrity through the representation as well as optimise readability. Axis should never be truncated (origin at zero), in fact when you do this you distort the perceived length or height of the bar (in a bar chart), it creates the impression of highly noticeable relative difference between values when the absolute values do not support this. The only instance in which this may be reasonable is when you have a main graphic which effectively offer a thumbnail view of the whole chart for orientation positioned alongside a separate associated chart. This separate chart might have a truncated axis that would function as a magnified view of the main chart. A line chart does not necessarily need a zero origin. If it does not encode quantitative values through size, the truncation of a value axis will not impact on perceiving the relative values against the scale and the general trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **mapping projections**: one of the most contentious matter relates to thematic mapping and specifically to the choice of map projection used. The main things that you need to know are:\n",
    "  - every type of map projection has some sort of distortion\n",
    "  - the larger the area of the Earth portrayed as a flat map, the greater the distortion\n",
    "  - there is no single right answer, it is often about choosing the least-worst case.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Thematic mapping is generally best portrayed using mapping projections based on equal-area calculations, sacrificing the shape over the size; this way values are correctly represented by proprtion of regional area. Anyway, there are a lot of variables in play: the scope of view, the distance from the equator of the region of focus, whethere you are focusing on land, sea or sky, etc.\n",
    "  Possible projections are:\n",
    "    - **Mercator**: it has been widely discredited in its role as a means of portraying the world (due to the distortions at the poles); nonetheless it is still the mosto common projection used. This is because of its rectangular dimensions that support seamless zooming. When using this projection you should stick to a regional level so the distortions are minimised, especially for regions around the equator.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Albers Equal-area Conic**: this is a conic projection, highly reccomended for presenting maps at a lower regional level, such as a country or subcontinent view.\n",
    "    - **Lambert Azimuthal Equal-area**: this is a spherical projection, reccomended for hemisphere or continent level views (e.g., it is reccomended for European mapping purpose)\n",
    "    - **Winkel-Tripel**: it is considered the best projection for viewing the world (adopted by National Geographic)\n",
    "    - **Mollweide**: it is an equal-area projection that offers greater emphasis on the accuracy of ocean areas, is reccomended for atmosphericmapping (e.g. flight paths)."
